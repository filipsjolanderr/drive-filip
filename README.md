## Fun follow ups

### Folder deletions

Make sure you fetch all of the folders that have it as a parent, and their children too
### Folder creations
Make a server action that takes a name and parentId, and creates a folder with that name and parentId (don't forget to set the ownerId).
### Access control
Check if user is owner before showing the folder page.
### Make a "file view" page
You get the idea. Maybe check out my last tutorial?
### Toasts!
### Gray out a row while it's being deleted
